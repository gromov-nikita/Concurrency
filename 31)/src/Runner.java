/*
Exercise 31: (8) Change DeadlockingDiningPhilosophers.java so that when a
philosopher is done with its chopsticks, it drops them into a bin. When a philosopher wants
to eat, it takes the next two available chopsticks from the bin. Does this eliminate the
possibility of deadlock? Can you reintroduce deadlock by simply reducing the number of
available chopsticks?
